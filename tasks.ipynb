    "Newton's method for estimating the square root of a real number is a specific instance of a more general method of called Newton-Raphson's method for estimating the root of real function.

The while loop will continue as long as the difference between the previous approximation ($x_{n}$) and the improved approximation ($x_{n+1}$) is greater than the tolerance. As the sequence converges it will reach a point where the difference is less than the tolerance and the while loop terminates. This gives the final approximation of the square root of $a$."
